**Poeng** : 1000

In 1922 a sailor has emigrated from Fj√¶re, Norway. He was born in 1890 and embarked on a journey towards New York on board a ship named "Stvr.fj.".

He left a substantial fortune to his descendants, who we are desperately trying to find. We believe, that we have found the name of his wife, but in order for all of the paperwork to be complete, we need to obtain her last name.

The documents seem to be missing some information and it was initially thought that her name was only 2 parts, but after further digging we uncovered the third name.

If you can confirm our findings, please submit his wife's last name in the flag format (with first letter capital, the rest lowercase). For example, if you concluded that the wife's full name is Marthe Eriksen Bratlie, the flag will be: EPT{Bratlie}.
