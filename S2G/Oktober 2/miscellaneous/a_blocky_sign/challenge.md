# A blocky sign
**Poeng** : 500

My friends and I recently returned to Minecraft, but we preferred an older version due to not liking the bad combat update. While walking my usual mining path, instead of finding diamonds, I stumbled upon a flag.

This challenge was made by Shirajuki during DREAM 2024. The flag format is DREAM24{...}

HINT: Use the coordinates to figure out the correct order of the letters in the flag.


- **Flag format:** DREAM24{...}
