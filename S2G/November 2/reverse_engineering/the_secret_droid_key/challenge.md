# The secret droid key
**Poeng** : 500

We have discovered an Android app that seems to be performing harmful activities. We have located the server the app is communicating with, but we need a key to access the server and check what has been extracted. The app seems to be authenticating against the server using such a key, but it is using state of the art encryption, so we haven't been able to extract the key. Can you help uncover the key sent from the app to the server?
