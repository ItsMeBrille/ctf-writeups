# Password Store
**Poeng** : 500

I used an online encrypted pastebin to store the flag and I stored the password and address in my password store.

My password manager is not your conventional password manager. It consists of a `password_store` binary and a `password_restore` binary for packing and unpacking the password store, respectively.

My computer recently became a victim of a virus that deleted a bunch of files, and the `password_restore` was one of them. Luckily my password store was locked, so they were unable to read my plaintext passwords! However, I am now unable to unlock my password store, meaning I can't give you the flag.

If you are able to unlock my password store, you deserve the flag stored in the online encrypted pastebin!

You will be compensated handsomely if you can help me regain access to my passwords!
