# Structured Annuity
**Points** : 362

These J.G. Wentworth ads are getting out of hand! Now we're evem getting reports that they're using malware to try and get people cash for their structured settlements! Luckily, we were able to capture some network traffic of this c2 beacon, along with the binary and a memory capture of the running process. Unfortunately, it seems like the c2 agent contains no static keys and instead generates them at run time. Can you decrypt their comms?
