# Phase One
**Points** : 100

We had one of our agents infiltrate an adversary's lab and  photograph a gateway device that can get us access to their network. We need to develop an exploit as soon as possible. Attached is a picture of the device. Get us intel on what MCU the device is utilizing so we can continue with our research.
