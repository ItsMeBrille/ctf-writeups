# Password Protector
**Points** : 100

We've been after a notorious skiddie who took the "Is it possible to have a completely secure computer system" question a little too literally. After he found out we were looking for them, they moved to live at the bottom of the ocean in a concrete box to hide from the law. Eventually, they'll have to come up for air...or get sick of living in their little watergapped world. They sent us this message and executable. Please get their password so we can be ready.
