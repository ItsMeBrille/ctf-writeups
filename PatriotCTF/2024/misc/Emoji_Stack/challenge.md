# Emoji Stack
**Points** : 100

Welcome to Emoji Stack, the brand new stack based emoji language! Instead of other stack based turing machines that use difficult to read and challenging characters like + - and [], Emoji Stack uses our proprietary patent pending emoji system.

The details of our implentation is below:

游녤: Move the stack pointer one cell to the right
游녣: Move the stack pointer one cell to the lef
游녨: Increment the current cell by one, bounded by 255
游녩: Decrement the current cell by one, bounded by 0
游눫: Print the ASCII value of the current cell
游대##: Repeat the previous instruction 0x## times
The Emoji Stack is 256 cells long, with each cell supporting a value between 0 - 255.

As an example, the program "游녨游대47游눫游녤游녨游대68游눫游녤游녨游대20游눫" Would output "Hi!" with the following execution flow:

[0, 0, 0, 0] 游녨游대47

[0x48, 0, 0, 0] 游눫游녤: H

[0x48, 0, 0, 0] 游녨游대68

[0x48, 0x69, 0, 0] 游눫游녤: i

[0x48, 0x69, 0, 0] 游녨游대20

[0x48, 0x69, 0x21, 0] 游눫: !
